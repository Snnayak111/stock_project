# StockProject

StockProject is an Android application for managing and tracking stock wishlists. It uses modern Android development practices, including Kotlin, Jetpack libraries, Room database, and dependency injection with Hilt.

## Features
- Two main tabs: *Stocks* (Explore) and *Watchlist*
- *Explore Screen*: View Top Gainers and Losers in a grid of cards with stock/ETF information
- *Watchlist Screen*: Manage all your watchlists, with an empty state when no watchlists are present
- *Product (Details) Screen*: View detailed stock/ETF info, including a line graph of prices; add/remove stocks to/from watchlists with dynamic icon updates
- *Add to Watchlist Popup*: Add a new watchlist or select an existing one to add stocks; persistent storage of user watchlists
- *View All Screen*: Paginated list of all stocks in a section (e.g., all gainers/losers)
- *API Integration*: Fetch data from Alpha Vantage (Top Gainers/Losers, Company Overview, Ticker Search)
- *Loading, Error, and Empty States*: User-friendly handling for all network and data states
- *Caching*: API responses are cached with expiration for better performance
- *Modern UI*: Material Design components and responsive layouts
- *Well-structured Codebase*: Follows a modular and maintainable folder structure
